This game was built upon the existing game [Hextris](https://hextris.io/). The main differences of our version of the game are, we added more features to the Hextris game.
The features are:
- Added new shapes to the game. Previously the only shape was a hexagon. Now, players can choose between triangle, square, pentagon and hexagon.
- Added music to the game.
- Made the game scalable to different screen sizes.
